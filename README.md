# Fastfood transform layer for caffe

This is an implementation of FastFood Transform in caffe based on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7149">Deep Fried Convnets</a>

# Note

The GPU version of Fast Hadamard Transform(FHT) and permutation transform are missing. So the cpu and gpu computation are mixed in *_gpu().
